# MVC-PE
This is my first Java MVC (Model-View-Controller) project, which demonstrates the implementation of the MVC architectural pattern in a Java application.
#Project overview
The project showcases the use of the MVC pattern to organize code and separate concerns in a Java application. It provides a basic structure for managing data, user interface, and business logic in a modular and maintainable manner.

The project includes the following components:

Model: Contains the business logic and data management code. It encapsulates the data and provides methods for accessing and manipulating it.

View: Handles the user interface and presentation logic. It interacts with the user and displays data from the model.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, updates the model accordingly, and updates the view to reflect the changes.
